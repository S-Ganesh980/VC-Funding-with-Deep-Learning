# VC-Funding-with-Deep-Learning
This is a machine learning model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by a Venture Capital Firm.


Here we will predict whether an applicant will be successful if funded by a VC-firm.
Our dataset consists of over 34,000 organizations that are funded by a VC-firm. We will use Machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will be successful.
